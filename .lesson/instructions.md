# Instructions  

This project is going to extend some of the ideas from project #4 -- the one where we made a box whose color changed randomly each time you clicked on it. 

But this time the color will cycle through one of three different values, and we will make a grid of boxes.  This makes it possible to make patterns using the grid

You can find a working example of what we're going to do here: https://itmeson.github.io/pattern-machine/

The interaction goes like this:

1. select the number of rows and columns you want, hit submit
2. A grid of red boxes will be generated to match your choice
3. If you click on the boxes they will cycle through 3 different color values

Play around for a few minutes on the example page, then make a plan for your code -- what specifically will we have to do:

1. On the html file?
2. On the css file?
3. On the js file?

Then we're going to work through building the program together.
